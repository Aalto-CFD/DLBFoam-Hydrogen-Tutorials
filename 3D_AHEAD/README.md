# 3D turbulent premixed flame (AHEAD)
This is a validation study of the AHEAD premixed burner carried out under stable conditions at an equivalence ratio of 0.6. The simulations were conducted using OpenFOAM with FickianTransportFoam and DLBFoam, as published in Ref.[[1]](#1) and Ref.[[2]](#2). AHEAD is a premixed swirl-stabilized burner, which is enhanced for flashback over a wide range of operating conditions, using hydrogen as fuel. The experimental work was carried out by Reichel et al. [[3]](#3).
