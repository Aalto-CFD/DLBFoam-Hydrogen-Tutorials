# DLBFoam-Hydrogen-Tutorials
This repository provides advanced hydrogen combustion tutorial cases with enhanced transport modelling with FickianTransportFoam and chemistry acceleration with DLBFoam for OpenFOAM

The detailed discussion and validation of the provided tutorial cases are openly available in Ref. [[1]](#1)


## Tutorial cases

The provided tutorial cases represent the following:

* [2D laminar freely propagating premixed flame](2D_planar_flame/README.md)
* [2D axi-symmetric laminar non-premixed jet flame](2D_jet_flame/README.md)
* [3D turbulent non-premixed flame (HYLON, Flame A)](3D_HYLON_flame_A/README.md)
* [3D turbulent premixed flame (AHEAD)](3D_AHEAD/README.md)

As there are many more experimental benchmarks of various combustion phenomena that have not been tested, we would be happy to receive your contribution using the **DLBFoam** and reporting the speed-up and scaling effects against standard solvers.

## Citation

If you use our tutorial cases, please cite the paper discussing these test cases [[1]](#1), together with the [original DLBFoam paper](https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/DLBFoam#citation), also noted in Ref. [[2]](#2).
